### Speed Meter

Displays a Graph on your screen of your current velocity when moving. Allows you to find more optimal pathing, additionally it proves that knifing while running is faster!

### Widescreen Fix

Fixed a bug in the Redux games where the Aspect Ratio is not calculated properly, resulting int 16:9 Ratios even when using an Ultra Wide resolution like 21:9

### Warp Manager

Allows you to create "checkpoints" so to speak. You can create a warp point and teleport back to it later. 

Your rotation is stored as well!
